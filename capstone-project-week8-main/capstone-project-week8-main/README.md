# capstone-project-week8

In my personal life I love creating! & I always find myself thinking "how could I improve ...". Thus my project: Contacted.App. In my day to day of meeting people & exchanging contact info? I thought of a way to deconstruct the processes & use an innovative techy app to streamline the entire interaction.

Contacted.App encompasses contact info as well as social media bios for any individual. It then allows the individual to send all their entered data in 1 contact form to the receiver by just a phone number. Think of it like the business card for the individual. But if you wanted to use Contacted.App for business? You certainly could.

Contacted.App has an area to upload your choice of avatar. Multiple data entry points to input your personal links & icons to support your entered data. Then a simple phone # entry for the receiver of your info.

It was quite the challenge for me to get my app to a pleasing aesthetic level. It was also difficult for me to create my own axios requests. Yet the strife is worth every second when you start to truly grasp the concepts behind these technologies.

I believe in Contacted.App. I believe it would have great utility in the real world. I know its something me & my loved ones could benefit from. I also know it can add long term value to the social interaction process. All these positive outcomes are rewarding & the exact reason I wish to dedicate my career to honing skills & become the best possible creator I can be.
